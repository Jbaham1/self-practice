First, you'll start by building a simple web page using HTML. You can edit code in your code editor, which is embedded into this web page.

Do you see the code in your code editor that says <h1>Hello</h1>? That's an HTML element.

Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag.

Opening tags look like this:

<h1>

Closing tags look like this:

</h1>

The only difference between opening and closing tags is the forward slash after the opening bracket of a closing tag.

Each challenge has tests you can run at any time by clicking the "Run tests" button. When you pass all tests, you'll be prompted to submit your solution and go to the next coding challenge.

The h2 element you will be adding in this step will add a level two heading to the web page.

This element tells the browser about the structure of your website. h1 elements are often used for main headings, while h2 elements are generally used for subheadings. There are also h3, h4, h5 and h6 elements to indicate different levels of subheadings.

Add an h2 tag that says "CatPhotoApp" to create a second HTML element below your "Hello World" h1 element.

Create a p element below your h2 element, and give it the text "Hello Paragraph".

Note: As a convention, all HTML tags are written in lowercase, for example <p></p> and not <P></P>.
